Emotion Detection through Real-Time Facial Emotion Recognition with Dynamic Emoji Representation using deep learning presents a novel method for analyzing emotions. The proposed work uses a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize facial expressions in real-time. Dynamic emoji representation is a creative addition that goes beyond conventional emotion labels to give consumers visually expressive and captivating feedback. The graphical user interface (GUI), which shows the live camera stream together with emojis that correspond to identified emotions, improves user interaction. The use of a Localization Network enhances the system's functionality and opens up possibilities for bounding box prediction and face feature localization. Additionally, the study prevents overfitting by utilizing dropout layers in the CNN architecture to maintain model robustness. Preprocessing and region-of-interest identification are improved by the practical integration of OpenCV for face detection. This study contributes to the field of emotion analysis by offering a fresh and user-friendly platform for comprehending and expressing human emotions in real-time, while simultaneously advancing the technological landscape with deep learning and real-time processing and prioritizing user experience.
